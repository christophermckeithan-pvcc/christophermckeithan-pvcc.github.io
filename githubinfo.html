                        <li>Q. What is a version control system?
                            <br> A. A system that tracks changes made to files over time, allowing users to revert back to previous version of a project, see who made specific edits, and collaborate effectively on a project by keeping a history of all changes made to the code.</br>
                        </li>
                        <li>Q. What is Git?
                            <br> A. a free, open-source version control system that helps developers track changes to their code and collaborate on projects</br>
                        </li>
                        <li>Q. What is GitHub?
                            <br> A. A web-based platform that allows developers to store, share, and collaborate on code</br>
                        </li>
                        <li>Q. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
                            <br> A. Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for git repositories. In simple terms, you can use git without Github, but you cannot use GitHub without Git.</br>
                        </li>
                        <li>Q. Who started GitHub and how was it started?
                            <br> A. The idea for GitHub originated with Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel operating system, in 2005. Torvalds created Git, an open-source distributed version control system (DVCS), as a way to maintain Linux. Git allows users to view a program's source code, development history, bug tracking, and integration plans.</br>
                        </li>
                        <li>Q. What company owns it now?
                            <br> A. In 2018, Microsoft acquired GitHub for $7.5 billion, making it a subsidiary of Microsoft Corporation. </br>
                        </li>
                        <li>Q. How much does a GitHub account cost?
                            <br> A. GitHub offers free and paid plans for storing and collaborating on code. Some plans are available only to personal accounts, while other plans are available only to organization and enterprise accounts.</br>
                        </li>
                        <li>Q. What is the Octocat?
                            <br> A. The Octocat is the mascot for GitHub, the world's largest software development platform. It's a mythical creature that's part octopus and part cat, and is often depicted with eight arms and cat-like features.</br>
