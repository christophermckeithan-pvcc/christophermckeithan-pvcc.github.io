In these cases, the program for performing the current task is placed at a predetermined location in main memory, executed, and then replaced by the program for performing the next task. However, in multiuser or multitasking environments in which the computer is asked to address many needs at the same time, the duties of the memory manager are extensive. In these cases, many programs and blocks of data must reside in main memory concurrently. Thus, the memory manager must find and assign memory space for these needs and ensure that the actions of each program are restricted to the program’s allotted space.</td>
